* counsel-web -- Dynamic web search and suggestions with ivy

** Description
   Search the web with dynamic suggestions and browse the results -- all from the comfort of Emacs and ivy.

** Demo

** Usage

*** Suggestions
    =counsel-web-suggest= shows search suggestions as you type. Press =RET= to accept the suggestion and send it to =counsel-web-search=.

*** Search
    =counsel-web-search= searches and presents the results in the ivy minibuffer. 

- Press =RET= to browse to the selected result.
- Type a new search and press =C-j= to update the search.
- Press =C-M-j= (=ivy-alternate-action=) to choose a secondary action.
- Press =M-o= to choose from a menu of alternate actions.

*** Settings

**** Change the default browser
     To open the selected result in the operating system browser instead of Emacs:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq counsel-web-search-action #'browse-url)
#+end_src

**** Change the alternate browser
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq counsel-web-search-alternate-action #'w3m)
#+end_src

**** Change Search Engines
     DuckDuckGo and Google are built in. DuckDuckGo is the default. Change to Google like this:

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq counsel-web-engine 'google)
     #+end_src

     See =counsel-web-engine-alist= to learn how to add more search engines.

**** Update search results with each keystroke
     *Experimental!* To update the search (not suggestions--the actual search results) with each key press:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq counsel-web-search-dynamic-update t)
#+end_src

Note that dynamic updates can sometimes lead the search engine to temporarily block requests if it decides Emacs is a running a search robot. This seems to be a bigger problem with DuckDuckGo than with Google. Suggestions regarding how to fix this are welcome.

** Installation
   Add =counsel-web.el= into your =load-path= and do something like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'counsel-web)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c w") #'counsel-web-suggest)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c W") #'counsel-web-search)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-w") #'counsel-web-thing-at-point)
#+end_src

** Similar Projects

*** =counsel-search= in counsel itself
    =counsel-search= is very similar to =counsel-web-suggest=. However, =counsel= currently does not provide an equivalent to =counsel-web-search=.

*** Google this
    https://github.com/Malabarba/emacs-google-this
    Google this searches Google for things under point, somewhat similar to =counsel-web-thing-at-point=. However, it does not have equivalent functions to =counsel-web-suggest= or =counsel-web-search=.

*** Engine-mode
    https://github.com/hrs/engine-mode
    Engine-mode sends a search to the browser, it doesn't parse the search and results in Emacs.

*** Helm-google
    https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/helm-google
    The most similar, it displays search results in the helm buffer like =counse-web= does in the ivy minibuffer.
